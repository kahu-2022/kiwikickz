## Final Group Project

@Lewis: Please add a short blurb about:
1) What this app is in 1 sentence
2) Why the world (or your son) needs it
3) What it does / what the main user-roles can do

## Organising ourselves
- [Social contracting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pwtqSxUZA12r6_vuwfvo1w0ZCwHQp8M2m3-ed3RIxl0/edit)

## MVP
On the homepage, as an unregistered user I can...<br>
... see a curated list of products, well shoes.<br>
... filter and search the products<br>
... click on a product and explore details of the product<br>
... get general information about the company and the authentication process<br>

as an unregistered user viewing a single product I can...<br>
... carussel through pictures of the product and click on pics to enlarge it<br>
... read a description of the product<br>
... read past questions and their answers and post my own question(s)<br>
... "buy now" and see the items I have bought in a cart<br>
... "make an offer" and see a confirmation of my offer<br>
<br>
as an unregistered user viewing the cart, I can...<br>
... see all the shoes I have bought and then proceed to checkout (enter my details and submit)<br>
... get a confirmation of my purchase (faked for MVP)<br>
<br>
As an Admin I can upload a product on behalf of a seller<br>

### Stretch
Plenty of ideas which we will discuss later

## Views (Client Side)

| name          | purpose                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Home          | View to browse products                                                                                                  |
| Product       | View to inspect a single product and decide to either "buy now" or "make an offer"                                       |

| about         | View for user to get general information about store and show authentication process                                     |

Later maybe:

| name          | purpose                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Login         | View for user to enter their login credentials                                                                           |
| Register      | View for user to sign up for the App                                                                                     |
